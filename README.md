## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install `Apache2` as web server and `PHP` on your machine by running the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install apache2
    sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
    ```

3. Start the Apache web server by running

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start apache2
    ```

4. Move the cloned project directory to the Apache document root. For example, if the document root is `/var/www/html`, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo mv space_frenzy_game_website /var/www/html
    ```

5. Adjust the firewall to allow Web traffic

    ```bash
    sudo ufw app list
    sudo ufw allow in "Apache"
    ```

    Note: `Apache` profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic). Since we haven’t configured SSL for our server yet, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80.
    
    Verify the change by typing and the output will provide a list of allowed traffic.

    ```bash
    sudo ufw status
    ```

6. If you don't know your server's IP address, use below command

    ```bash
    hostman -I
    ```

When you have your server’s IP address, enter it into your browser’s address bar
